Multiwell P24 LED plate illuminator for optogenetics

This is a low-cost, open-source P24 plate illuminator based on readily available electronic components. The plate is designed to illuminate a standard corning-type multiwell plate (like the ones used in cell and tissue culture) in a per-well basis, using a single LED that can be easily replaced.
The system is designed to be easily accessible and even if it requires some python coding, the aim is to make it as easy to build and operate as possible, being easier to build than other alternatives and with fewer skills required.
